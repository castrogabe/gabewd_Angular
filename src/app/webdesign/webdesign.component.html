      <h2>Web Design</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The process of designing a website: email me to schedule an appointment near Victorville or Inland Empire.
          If a physical appointment is not necessary we can chat about your
          vison.
        </li>

        <li>
          I will produce a written quote based on your vision and amount of
          revisions.
        </li>

        <li>
          I will produce a design concept of your website before any coding is
          done and you are happy with the design.
        </li>
      </ol>
